In this project I created a sample landing page based off an example provided by TOP. I learned some new skills during the process, such as the use of background images and interactive buttons. The project was most useful for solidifying my knowledge of basic html and css use.

I scrapped my first draft because I was dissatisfied with its look and my code was a mess. In the newer version I made efforts to increase the originality of the webpage and the organization of my code.
